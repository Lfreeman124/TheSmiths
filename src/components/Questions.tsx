    question: "Transportation",
    answer:
      "We plan to arrange transportation between Wedderlie and The Black Bull in Lauder. If you are staying in Edinburgh or elsewhere, please arrange your own transportation in advance, as there aren't many taxis that far outside of the city.",
  },
  {
    question: "Dress Code",
    answer:
      "For those of you that aren't British, weddings are a big deal there. Women will mostly be in heels and they wear these accessories called fascinators. Most men will wear kilts, and those who aren't Scottish are also welcome to wear a kilt. They can be rented in Edinburgh for around Â£80, and this might be your only opportunity. That being said, we chose Wedderlie because it is laid-back and rustic, so we're going for a nice balance. Scotland can be chilly and wet, even in July, so plan to bring a warmer layer just in case.",

    question: "Menu",
