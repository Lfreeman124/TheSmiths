    question: "Transportation",
    answer:
      "We plan to pre-arrange transportation between Wedderlie and The Black Bull in Lauder for Friday and Saturday, either with a few pre-booked taxis or a small bus. If you are returning to Edinburgh on Saturday, please arrange your own transportation in advance, as there aren't many taxis that far outside of the city.",

    question: "Dress Code",
    answer:
      "For those of you that aren't British, weddings are a big deal there. Women will mostly be in heels and they wear these accessories called fascinators. Most men will wear kilts, and those who aren't Scottish are also welcome to wear a kilt. They can be rented in Edinburgh for around Â£80, and this might be your only opportunity. That being said, we chose Wedderlie because we like that it is laid-back and rustic, so we're going for a nice balance. Scotland can be chilly and wet, even in July, so plan to bring a warmer layer just in case.",

We will send more information by email as we arrange accommodation for those staying at Wedderlie and The Black Bull. All food will be provided.",

    question: "Where can I get my hair and makeup done?",
